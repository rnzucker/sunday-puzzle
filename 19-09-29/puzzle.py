"""Playing around with Python to solve the NPR Sunday Puzzle for 2019-09-29

Think of a word that has five vowels â€” two E's, an I, O, and U. Curiously,
every vowel except the "I" is pronounced like a short "I." And the "I" in
the word is not pronounced at all. What word is it?

This should print out every word that has exactly two E's, and one I, one O,
and one U. From there the reader must eyeball it.
