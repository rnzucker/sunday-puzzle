Brief programs to help solve the NPR Sunday Puzzle challenges.
Only about 20-25% of the puzzles lend themselves to writing a program
to help solve them. In some cases the programs just narrow down the
possibilities to the point of scanning them manually.

There will be a sub-directory for each puzzle.
